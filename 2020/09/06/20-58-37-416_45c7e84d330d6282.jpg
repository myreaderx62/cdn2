			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I’ve Been Bigly And Bad (The Trump Musical) - here full manuscript. The reviews are fantastic:<br /><br /><strong><em>‘Sidesplittingly funny’</em> </strong>- Variety<br /><em><strong>‘Hilarious, you’ll die laughing’</strong></em> - Village Voice<br /><em><strong>‘Superb, magnificent, hysterical’</strong> </em>- Time<br /><em><strong>‘Best show on Broadway 27 years running’</strong></em> - Newsweek<br /><em><strong>‘Disgraceful and disrespectful of the former President languishing in prison’</strong></em> - Fox<br /><br />Here is the original manuscript of the runaway hit Broadway Musical of the dumbest American President including all the parody songs we so love, from the Beatles to Elvis to Queen to Abba to Justin Timberlake to Creedence Clearwater Revival and Bing Crosby. 21 parody songs and a script to put the sillyness together for you. As you might not always remember exactly how that given song went, I have included a link to the original recording so you can match the original artist singing to the new lyrics in this parody version. Enjoy<br /><br /><br />Excerpt from the Broadway play program guide: <em>I&#39;ve Been Bigly And Bad (The Trump Musical) is America&#39;s longest-running hit Broadway play now in its 28th year selling to sold-out rooms. Featuring 21 parody songs the play chronicles the short but increasingly messy Presidency of the man now listed as &#39;Moron-In-Chief&#39; in history textbooks. The Musical features numbers covering all main characters from this chaotic point in US politics, including Rudy Giuliani, Michael Cohen, Vice President Pence, Vladimir Putin, Stormy Daniels, Sarah Sanders and all the names we now associate with that shameful period like Avenatti, Melania, Mueller, Maddow, Kelly, Scaramucci, Don Jr, etc. The musical includes the popular confession song by Trump of his true feelings about President Obama.</em><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>ACT 1 - STORMY<br /><br /></strong>(Curtain opens)<br /><br />(a dishevilled middle aged office worker man is working hunched in a dark office, overstuffed with books, cobwebs, dust, he is working on some accounting ledgers and consulting paperwork)<br /><br />(door opens)<br /><br /><strong>Secretary</strong> - Mr Cohen, here is Mr Trump’s latest pornstar’s contract<br /><br /><strong>Cohen</strong> - Thank you Mildred, place it on the pile of porn star contracts there<br /><br />(Michael Cohen, Donald Trump&#39;s attorney and &#39;fixer&#39; pauses, stretches on his chair, gets up, starts to sing)<br /><br />(a choir forms to sing backup for Cohen)<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>MONEY MONEY MONEY<br /></strong>(Abba) (Link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaktsSampdY">song</a>)<br /><br />I work all night, I work all day, to pay Trump girls I have to pay <br />(Ain&#39;t it sad)<br />And still there never seems to be a payment from Trump back to me<br />(Makes him mad!)<br />In my dreams I have a plan, I’m gonna sing to the Mueller man<br />I wouldn&#39;t have to lie at all, I&#39;d tell the truth: I taped the call!<br /><br />Money, money, money, to that honey, it’s the Stormy girl<br />Money, money, money, must be runny, in the Trump man&#39;s world<br />Aha-ahaaa, all the things he can hide<br />As he has a little money, tt&#39;s a Trump man&#39;s world<br /><br />A girl like that is hard to find but Trump can&#39;t get them off his mind<br />(Ain&#39;t it sad)<br />And if one’s willing for a hump, we know they’d never fancy Trump<br />(That&#39;s too bad)<br />So he must leave, he’ll have to go, To Las Vegas or else Moscow<br />A prostitute will have no shame, his life will never be the same...<br /><br />Money, money, money, Playboy Bunny, in the Trump man&#39;s world<br />Money, money, money, ‘Pee Tape’s’ funny, in the Trump man&#39;s world<br />Aha-ahaaa, no more things he can hide<br />As he’s having no more money, it&#39;s a Trump man&#39;s world<br /><br />Yes every woman understands, about the man with tiny hands...<br />(Ain’t it bad?)<br />The sex so lame, you have to pay, and make them sign an NDA<br />(Ain’t it sad?)<br />To find his wives, he&#39;ll have to go, Slovenia or Kosovo<br />And pay a fortune in a sham, else no woman takes that man<br /><br />Its just: money, money, money; never sunny, in the Trump man’s world.<br />Its just, money, money, money, pretend honey, is the Trump man’s girl.<br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /><br />(Spotlight dims, Cohen turns around, walks back to the desk and resumes his work)<br /><br />(while office light dims into darkness, a spotlight lights up the front of the stage)<br /><br />(Trump walks onto the front of the stage, dressed in a business suit. Behind him his Hitler Jugend kids walk in all wearing matching Nazi uniforms, the boys carrying stuffed heads of lions and giraffes)<br /><br /><strong>Trump</strong> - hey kids, isn’t it great to be a Trump?<br /><br /><strong>Trump Kids</strong> (in perfect unison) - Yes, dad, we love being a Trump<br /><br /><strong>Trump</strong> - now wait while I make a phone call<br /><br />(Trump walks to edge of stage, mumbles into a phone)<br /><br />(Trump kids talk amongst themselves)<br /><br /><strong>Ivanka</strong>&#0160;(to Don Jr) - So, Junior, are you going to take the fall for daddy? You know, lie about the Trump tower meeting with the Russians? <br /><br /><strong>Don Jr</strong> - I dunno…daddy has never shown me as much love he’s shown you <br /><br /><strong>Ivanka </strong>- Are you jealous of our relationship?

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So this blog is about the Helsinki Hostage Summit where Trump was exposed as being Putin’s Puppet, on global TV and to the horror of Americans and the world. I have a working theory of how we got here, and the key is: the Republicans <em><strong>thought they’d get away with it</strong></em>, because everybody <em><strong>knew</strong></em>, that Trump <em><strong>could not possibly win</strong></em> against Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So this is my first political blog since the election (welcome back political readers, and no, there is NOTHING in this blog about my other topics, tech, media and mobile). Lets start first with the jokes. If you just visited this blog to get ‘those jokes’, they are here in the top and the lyrics to the songs are far on the bottom. So first the jokes.</p>
<p>After the Helsinki Hostage Summit, we now know not only that Trump should spell his name with two letter P’s as he is the TrumPP; he is <strong>Putin’s Puppet</strong>.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The Republican party is often called the GOP for the Grand Old Party. That no longer is true, the <strong>GOP now is Government Of Putin</strong>.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The National Rifle Association ie the <strong>NRA is now the National Russia Association</strong> (or if you want to be pedantic, it should be called the National Russification Association).</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I had been calling Trump the Moron-In-Chief. He is many things like the Liar-In-Chief and the Racist-In-Chief. But now we have the worst conceivable title for what should be the USA’s Commander-In-Chief. Trump was revealed to actually be the <strong>Traitor-In-Chief</strong>.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>And his flock? Those in the Republican party who support Trump? That is a cult. That cult was built meticulously over the years, over decades, cultivated and refined in its purity and hatred, by Fox News. We have a name for them. They are the <strong>Cult45</strong>. As in Trump President number 45 and a play on the Colt revolver pistol and a ‘malt liquor’ (lager beer) of a similar name. So here our new mocking terms</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Helsinki Hostage Summit<br />Putin’s Puppet<br />GOP = Government Of Putin<br />NRA = National Russia Association<br />Moron-In-Chief is now Traitor-In-Chief<br />Trump supporters = Cult45</p>
<p><br />And from our &#39;best hits&#39; collection, if you&#39;re here just for the jokes, lets do the old classic &#39;The Three Iron Laws of Trump&#39;<br /><br />First Laws Of Trump = Never Believe Anything Trump Says<br />Second Law Of Trump = Anything Trump Denies Is The Truth<br />Third Law Of Trump = For Every Trump Opinion There Must Exist An Equal And Opposite Trump Opinion<br /><br />There you go. Feel free to use those and mock the Trumpsters with them. Now if you’re here only for the jokes, not the analysis, jump to the bottom of this long blog. I will have the song parodies there (Sinatra, The Beatles, Amy Winehouse, Abba, Eurythmix and more). Meanwhile if you want my analysis of HOW the White House was sold to Vladimir Putin of Russia, lets get to my working theory. Follow me beyond the fold here:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Sorry for the radio silence on the blog, but there hasn&#39;t been that much really &#39;news&#39; in this space, compared to years past when we sometimes had to write several blog articles on the same day..</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So the past month or two? The Quarterly results cycle came in. The item often of great interest is the Apple iPhone performance. 52.2 million iPhones shipped and that gives roughly a flat market share compared to the year before, so about 14%-15%. I&#39;ll come and do the full math later of the quarterly data. That race is no longer in any way interesting.<br /><br /><br />But two Top 10 smartphone brands ARE in the news. One who is facing imminent death and the other who is making a miraculous return-from-dead. So imminent death and current Top 10 brand first. ZTE. The Trump administration has put a massive squeeze on ZTE and the company is in serious trouble of imminent collapse. Then bizarrely, Trump reversed course and felt he needed to protect CHINESE employment (???) and after yet another typical Trump-mess, we now are at a Never-Neverland where Trump&#39;s own party Republicans are revolting against their President and well, ZTE may end up a casualty of this mess. We&#39;ll keep an eye on it.<br /><br />In supremely delightful news, Nokia&#39;s come-back is well on schedule. The first major analyst house has now ranked Nokia smartphones back in the Top 10 (Strategy Analytics, for Q1 global numbers, see this <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/report-nokia-brand-improves-smartphone-vendor-ranking-market-share-in-q1-2018/">article via Nokia Power User</a>). They have given a count of 4.1 million Nokia smartphones sold in Q1 with 1.2% market share and a global ranking of 9th. Congrats HMD !!! Excellent work. Good luck further this year. This is the first analyst to give a Top 10 position for Nokia smartphones and that is only for the &#39;down&#39; quarter that follows Christmas sales peak quarter, so lets not yet read too much into it. But I predicted Nokia will return to the Top 10 this year, and even if currently they are on the cusp, and other analyst houses don&#39;t see it quite that good yet for HMD, this is a great trend to be on, continuing growth in market share, and we should see plenty of major analyst houses report this data during the Summer and then Autumn periods.<br /><br />Then onto more good news: Facebook is in serious trouble. Duh, they are the Evil Empire Mini-Me (with Microsoft being the true Evil Empire of all time, in tech). So just noted in passing, with the Cambridge Analytica mess, that Facebook is finally caught up in the disastrous business ethics their company was built upon. As I always preach in my lectures and seminars: &quot;Don&#39;t spam, don&#39;t spy; ask permission and satisfy.&quot; Facebook is the very antithesis of good behavior and the sooner they die away, the better. I don&#39;t in any way suggest Facebook (or Microsoft) to die in the foreseeable future, but I do expect that the next US Congress (when Democrats take control again) will act decisively against Facebook&#39;s over-reach and probably split up the company similar to how AT&amp;T the telecoms giant was broken up several decades ago.<br /><br />Ok, that is my quick brief update. I&#39;ll do the math on the Top 10 smartphone market share data in the near future too, for the record. And of the comments? Somehow the comments have been misbehaving on the blog, I&#39;ll try to sort that out, but we should all have comments open, of course, as always.</p>

				<p>It is time for the annual picture. Smartphone races. This blog is the only place where you get the full Top 10 market shares every quarter (for free). And the installed base of the smartphones. And the OS wars. With no registration. No ads. No spam. Just the facts... Plus as a bonus, my analysis as well...<br /><br />Let us start with the big picture. And before I do that, I need to tell you that I have changed the way I count one of the players. If you are not a regular reader of this blog, you probably never heard of &#39;BBK&#39; before. But if you follow smartphones, you probably have noticed the rapid rise of Vivo and Oppo out of China. Well, BBK is their parent and yes a giant Chinese electronics company that first started out making DVD players etc. Over the past few years they&#39;ve moved quite aggressively into the smartphone races. <br /><br />BBK is to smartphones what say General Motors is to cars. GM sells the popular Chevrolet and Pontiac and Cadillac brand cars (and used to also own the Opel brand in Germany, Vauxhall in Britain, Holden in Australia etc). Yet &#39;GM&#39; or General Motors generally is not a consumer car brand (although GM does sell trucks and heavier vehicles by that brand). Similarly BBK doesn&#39;t use the BBK brand to sell phones. It sells the increasingly popular Vivo and Oppo mass market brands that are major brands througout Asia, and are starting to appear on other continents as well. And what would be the Cadillac brand of BBK? It is OnePlus, the third major phone brand of the Chinese corporation (which has others as well). So to be clear. In the past, I listed BBK brands separately (Vivo and Oppo were large enough to fit into the Top 10). But that is not fair, as I count Motorola smartphone sales into Lenovo numbers, and Palm and Blackberry sales into TCL numbers together with Alcatel and their other brands. And we count Nubia into ZTE, etc. So we really do need to handle BBK as a manufacturer and do the proper global market share with the two big BBK brands added together. But do not despair. I will ALSO now break out the brand-based Top 10, as a separate table. So you get (of course) the best info, via the CDB blog. Your favorite source of all mobile industry stats... Now to the big table. Who won the year? (That was no contest, it is the same brand that wins this race every year - and by a mile)<br /><br /></p>

So for the actual global manufacturers, the big change is that Apple falls from number 2 slot last year (a position it has held since year 2012 after Nokia fell and Samsung jumped past Apple to take the top slot) to number 3 for year 2017. Note that Apple is on a downward trend from a peak of 20% global market share 6 years ago, to the last three years of 16%, 15% and now 14%. I expect Apple to drop to 13% by the end of this year, 2018. Meanwhile BBK the new number two? They have had a rocketship ride to number 2 and only breached the Top 10 three years ago. They were ranked third at the end of 2016 (with the revised accounting, by which their separate brands Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus are added together, as I have done for the above table). But look out Apple! Lurking in the wings is manufacturer brand number 4. Huawei! The Chinese giant is steadily growing, and last 3 years has gone from 8% to 9% to 10%. This year we will likely see a single quarter where Huawei outsells Apple, likely one of the summer quarters. And next year (2019) we&#39;ll see the fight for 12% market share, will Apple hold that third ranking or will Huawei snatch it? The trend says Apple will lose its share by 2020 the latest and fall to fourth rank among smartphone manufacturing companies globally.<br /><br />By the way, for those who &#39;hate Apple&#39; (and please don&#39;t count me into that group..). If you want to see the glass really really less than half full... Apple sales were flat in a year that was flat. Out of the Top 5, all other 4 manufacturers GREW their sales - Samsung by 3%, BBK by 29%, Huawei by 10% and Xiaomi by 70%. Don&#39;t fall into the silly trap to think, that Apple is somehow &#39;doing fine&#39;. It is LOSING the battle. Market share down AGAIN and now the reality is starting to come home to various developers, especially in the Emerging World, that actually, all you need is Android. This is EXACTLY the same disaster that hit the Mac world back way before Apple went close to bankruptcy. The believers were finally forced to face reality, that even as the Mac was far superior - as a user interface - to the early Windows - the Windows personal computers were &#39;good enough&#39; and most users wanted the major platform. And then the developers stopped supporting the tiny platform. The Mac OS never had 10% market share. iOS touched twice that, but is headed towards similar levels to ten percent. Currently at 14% and still declining. Now, if Apple &#39;wanted to&#39; - it COULD reverse this decline. But will they do that, or will they just continue to milk the rich users, until the users get fed up with paying the iTax? Who knows. Currently Apple is the richest company in the world. It won&#39;t remain that if it continues to abuse its customers. But still today, iPhone loyalty and customer satisfaction is incredjbly strong. Apple has a long time to figure out what it wants. Yet, as I&#39;ve said for years, the mistake of abandoning the future will come back to haunt Apple. Now most sane people see that iOS is a niche market, and only Android is a mass market. I told you so ten years ago...<br /><br />As to the industry, growth is down to snail&#39;s pace now. The global market for smartphones grew only by 1.8% last year vs 2016. The earlier part of the year showed better growth but the final quarter had a significant slowing down, all three of the major analyst houses that reported Q4 numbers had the quarter down vs the year before. As to the total annual sales, the three houses (Gartner, IDC and Strategy Analytics) don&#39;t quite agree. One thinks annual sales declined while tow think they grew. I use their numbers for the average of total market size, as always. Then I use my own sources and public sources to allocate the market shares on a &#39;best fit&#39; basis. Where companies are brave enough to give a true number (like well, it seems we&#39;re down to Apple and Huawei) we use those. Else I start from analyst reports and then use my best judgment for what math works best. Well. That is the manufacturer &#39;race&#39;. Let&#39;s do the new &#39;brand race&#39; table here as well, where we separate out the various brands like Vivo, Oppo for BBK and Motorola out of Lenovo, etc..:<br /><br /><br />&#0160;</p>

Apple slowly fading, now down to 14% again one point down vs the previous year. The Top 5 stays the same as the year before. Xiaomi doing a second run at the Top 5, just misses it. Gionee is the new brand that kicks out Alcatel/TCL from last year.<br /><br />BTW how good was my guidance? I <a href="https://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/page/2/">told you in November</a> what the Top 5 will look like for the full year. Three months ago I said that the Top 5 will be Samsung 21%, Apple 14%, Huawei 10%, Oppo 8% and Vivo 6% and that Xiaomi would be 6th. How did it turn out? EXACTLY that. Sammy 21, iPhone 14, Honor 10, Oppo and Vivo 8 and 6. And Xiaomi was left to 6th ranking.. Yeah.. Perhaps I do know a bit about this industry...<br /><br /><br />OS WARS<br /><br />So what about the operating systems? That war was won years ago by Android. We know that Apple sold 14.3% of all the smartphones in 2017. That is the OS market share for iOS. Android is nearly the rest. There is less than 0.5% of &#39;other&#39; OS platforms which nearly all have died. So Android has.. about 85.4%. So Android sells 6 times as many smartphones than Apple. This is just the smartphone new sales (bearing in mind, that Apple share is contiuously declining and Android continuously growing) but there also are &#39;non smartphone&#39; devices that you should add, to get the full reach of a platform. For Android we have tablets, smart watches, TV sets etc. For iOS it is the iPads and Apple Watches and whatnot. But this blog isn&#39;t about all tech platforms, I focus on where the most relevant tech is - the only universal gadget on the planet - mobile phones - and their evolution (= smartphones) and the various tech we do with them from voice calls and messaging to the cameraphone to the mobile internet (and haha, &#39;apps&#39; which is only games if you want to make money) to the future of such things as mobile money and Augmented Reality etc. For mobile phones, 79% of all phones sold in year 2017 were smartphones. I have revised my estimates of when the last dumbphones will be sold, and now look at year 2021 as the target year, when &#39;all&#39; ie by Q4 of that year, more than 99% of all new phones sold would be smartphones. From that year, it will still be a couple of years further, until the installed base reaches 99% smartphones (because older phones remain in use). Which brings us conveniently to that topic of &#39;installed base&#39;... how is that installed base of smartphones doing? Lets take another table<br /><br /><br />SMARTPHONE INSTALLED BASE AT END OF 2017 BY OPERATING SYSTEM<br /><br />Rank . .

Four out of five smartphones globally now run on Android, one in five runs on iOS. Out of the app store reach, pure Android OS that can access Play Store now number 1.8 Billion devices which is 3 times the reach of iPhones that can access Apple&#39;s App Store. Out of all Android compatible devices, one third are forked AOSP devices, two thirds are &#39;pure&#39; Android. Again with these numbers, remember these are only the smartphone reach. Tablets and other devices are excluded from both sides. Yes, once again only the CDB blog gives you the installed base race, not just the new sales. This is the relevant table obviously if you&#39;re any kind of developer.<br /><br /><br />Q4 NUMBERS<br /><br />And last but not least, here is the final calendar quarter of the year, Q4 numbers.

What is worth mentioning? Remember the iPhone annual sales pattern. There is no sudden surge by Apple. Samsung is SAFELY the largest smartphone maker (Annually) but for every year, the Christmas sales cycle produces the best quarter for Apple. Their share now declines in the next 3 quarters as it has done every year. I&#39;m now adding Vivo, Oppo and the other BBK brands into the BBK manufacturer ranking. That brings Coolpad back into the Top 10. Note the sales level that gets you into the Top 10. It takes about 5.5 million smartphone sales. Our old pal Sony are at 4.0 million. TCL/Alcatel/Blackberry/Palm etc is at 4.2 million. And ahead of both... is the rapidly returning <a href="https://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2018/02/nokia-hmd-comeback-first-year-finishes-with-85-million-smartphones-shipped-and-10-market-share-by-ye.html">Nokia, via HMD, which is at roughly 4.4 million units by my estimate</a>. They are going to make a run for a Top 10 position this year, and could breach the Top 10 ranking as early as by late summer data and hopefully by Christmas Quarter at least.<br /><br />PS thanks to reader Gustavo Vera correcting me on the current status of the (ex) GM car brands... and Per &quot;wertigon&quot; Ekström for noticing the Q4 ranking error (numbers were correct but ranking order was wrong). I always appreciate the help of our readers. &#0160; :-)<br /><br /></p>

				<p>We have the first published report of Nokia HMD smartphone global sales, <a href="http://nokiamob.net/2018/02/02/nokia-smartphones-captured-1-of-global-market-share-in-q4-2017-counterpoint-research/">via Nokiamob website</a> and the stats are reported by Counterpoint. They find Nokia HMD smartphones to have 1.0% market share at 4.15M units for Q4, worldwide. <br /><br /><br /><em><strong>UPDATE 14 FEB 2018</strong> - Counterpoint the analyst has revised their Nokia HMD number from 4.15M to 4.4M units as <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/nokia-smartphone-feature-phone-shipments-q4-2017-counterpoint-1812112">per this story at Gadgets 360</a>. I have updated the math based on the 4.4M story. The original article from Feb 3, had 4.15M as the Nokia number.</em><br /><br /><br />That gives us a good number to get the full year sales of the first year come-back for Nokia brand into smartphones.

My Twitter follower <a href="https://twitter.com/stipe1906">Stipe Hrzic aka @stipe1906</a> who tweeted about the story. And then also thanks to blog reader &#39;Sonan&#39;, who observed that Sony just sold 4.0 million smartphones and speculated, Nokia HMD may have already passed Sony for global smartphone sales. Thanks Sonan. It certainly seems like that has already happened in Q4.<br /><br />Nokia HMD is at 1.0% market share globally. The level to return to Top 10 is roughly twice that, from about 2 percent market share. Nokia HMD has been growing at about 1.5 million units more sales per quarter for two quarters (with slight growth) and was adding more countries and networks still in Q4 of last year. We should see some more growth organically just with more distribution added. Then the heavier lifting will start. Some of the fans of Nokias had gotten their first phones back, and that excitement will subside. The sales reverts to more traditional sales and marketing issues. Need to invest in more marketing and especially get carriers/operators to support the Nokia HMD comeback. We may well see a slowing down of the growth rate now, after the first year of excitement. But for Nokia HMD to already pass Sony, that must be good news.<br /><br />Now when will they pass 10 million units shipped? The current run rate is 1.5 million phones per month (4.4 million per quarter) and by that rate, sometime just about now, first week of February Nokia HMD will probably have passed their 10 millionth smartphone shipped, in their come-back. If so, we could expect Nokia HMD to celebrate that milestone at say Barcelona in a few weeks.<br /><br />This was one analyst giving a Nokia HMD number. We may get others. Let&#39;s see how that goes. But there IS a serious come-back going on. Already now. Nokia is at 1% of global smartphone market and growing. I told you last year that 1% by the end of the year was well within their cards. And if so, then 2% by the end of this year, 2018, would be also plausible. And THAT would be on the brink of returning to the Top 10. We may see Nokia back as a brand in the big smartphone wars in about a year from now, if these early growth trends continue. That would be amazing!<br /><br /><br /><em><strong>UPDATE 14 FEB 2018</strong> - So the <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/nokia-smartphone-feature-phone-shipments-q4-2017-counterpoint-1812112">same article</a> with the updated Counterpoint number, gave also other details. They count Nokia current global market share at 1.0% and the rank of Nokia brand among Top 10 smartphones as number 11. Meanwhile another analyst, <a href="https://www.dramexchange.com/WeeklyResearch/Post/5/4909.html">Trendforce, has counted</a> 11.5 Million as the final Nokia HMD smartphone number for year 2017 (significantly more than my count of 8.7M), and they also have Nokia currently at 1.0% market share, but Trendforce has given their projection that they expect Nokia to be at about 20 million smartphones sold this year 2018. Good signs...&#0160;</em><br /><br /><br />I will still wait, in case any other analysts report any Nokia numbers. When we have all data in, I&#39;ll do a forecast for this year.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Apple results are out (yes, world&#39;s most profitable company. This blog is NOT about profits or wall street stock performance). So how did Apple iPhone do in the smartphone wars? Lost another point of market share last year. That is what it did. Apple sales 77.3 million units in calendar Quarter 4 ie October-December Quarter. That is down 1% vs the same quarter last year (while the industry grew 5%). Currently Apple has its best moment of the year as the new phone models came out, and only manages 17% quarterly market share (previous years the Christmas Quarter had done better than 21% even). This is down from 18% market share this same quarter a year ago.<br /><br />For full year numbers, Apple just barely inched better sales than the year before. It was up by 400,000 units from 215.4M to 215.8M but that IS growth, technically. In reality it is less than half of one percent - so it is flat vs year before. Don&#39;t kid yourself. Apple annual sales were flat. And considering its headwinds this past year, that is doing pretty well, all things considered. But market share, that is a different story. Apple annual market share lost another point and is now at 14%.<br /><br />For the record, the Top 5 smartphone manufacturing companies globally for the year 2017 are:<br /><br />1 Samsung about 320 million units and 21% market share<br />2 BBK (=Vivo, Oppo &amp; OnePlus brands, from China) about 250 million units, 16% market share<br />3 Apple, 216 million units, 14% market share<br />4 Huawei, 153 million units, 10% market share<br />5 Xiaomi, about 90-95 million units, 6% market share<br /><br />And for Apple watchers, at one point Apple did 20% of all smartphones sold. The last three years? 16%, 15% and now 14%. I think we see the trend, eh?<br /><br />And obviously, it means that currently iOS only sells 14% of all new smartphones, constantly dropping in share, as Android is at 86% of new sales.<br /><br />Separately, that 77.3M gives us an intriguing wait for the estimates of Samsung&#39;s final Q4 number. I have it roughly estimated at 77.0M. And obviously if I happened to hit that number, then Apple would be larger than Samsung for the Q4 quarter (but obviously not for the full year). This means that the shortly-announced Q4 numbers from the major analyst houses will be an interesting news cycle. Some may be tempted to slightly push Samsung estimates down, to get Apple above Sammy, to get a good news story. And I&#39;m not suggesting any reputable analyst house would do that. It may very well be, that Apple did beat Samsung in the Christmas sales period. Now, if I was Samsung, AND if my number was above 77.3M, I would come out with my official number. Samsung very very rarely release any official or semi-official counts of their phone business. BUT obviously if Samsung is below 77.3, then they&#39;d just continue their normal policy of not releasing the number. Some intrigue there. Lets see how the big analyst houses count Sammy and take that average, and see who won the Christmas sales period last year. It will be nail-bitingly close...<br /><br />Ok. Remember in the comments, no discussion about Apple&#39;s obscene levels of profits, yes they are the most profitable company of all time. This blog is not a Wall Street investment blog. We are interested in the tech platforms and whatever hope some silly analysts had, of Apple somehow winning the platform wars, that myth was busted years ago. Apple&#39;s iOS is a niche OS platform for rich customers mostly in the Western and Industrialized countries. Android is the only smartphone platform of global and almost universal reach.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;m waiting for the final numbers to come out, so we can do the full year 2017 smartphone numbers and the numbers for Q4. Before we have our final numbers, a lot of individual news stories are expected.<br /><br />First, expect the story that &#39;Apple sells more than Samsung&#39; smartphones. This is the Q4 measurement (calendar Quarter, so October-to-December, not fiscal quarter) and it looks like Apple will have outsold Sammy in Q4. That does NOT mean that Apple is in any way ahead in the race. On the contrary, Apple is FALLING FURTHER BEHIND Samsung. How can that be? It is the LAUNCH CYCLE for Apple&#39;s new model. Every Christmas Apple has its best quarter, then does ever worse the next three quarters. So the real measure is the FULL YEAR sales. For full year sales, Samsung held even in market share at 21%, while Apple is far behind, at 14% and Apple yes, fell one point in market share from 15% in 2016. So the gap between Samsung and Apple is INCREASING, Apple is FALLING FURTHER behind. But that is reality. Expect many silly business &amp; tech writers, in the USA in particular, to fall for the story, that Apple is ahead of Samsung. Any honest reporting will tell readers that for full year sales, Samsung is safely ahead of Apple. Any &#39;fake news&#39; reporting will only talk about Q4 numbers and leave the reader with the impression that Samsung has fallen.<br /><br />Secondly, learn about the smartphone manufacturer company from China called BBK. We know that company for its smartphone brands Vivo, Oppo &amp; OnePlus. I have counted those brands separately into our Top 10 in the past, but that is not fair, as we count Motorola brand sales into Lenovo sales, etc, so as a manufacturer, yes, BBK has to be counted where its individual brands are added together. A year ago, using that method, BBK was the world&#39;s third largest smartphone maker in year 2016, behind Apple and ahead of Huawei. Now, for 2017, BBK has passed Apple. There will be a separate story, that Apple has FALLEN TO THIRD.<br /><br />So simultaneously we will hear stories that Apple is larger than Samsung, and that Apple has fallen from second rank to third rank in the smartphone races. Haha. And both are technically true statements.<br /><br />But yes, expect to learn a lot more about BBK. And yes, it is the world&#39;s second-largest smartphone manufacturing conglomerate, behind only Samsung and ahead of Apple, Huawei, LG, Xiaomi and the others that we so much love to follow on this blog. And if you want to know more about who is this BBK and how did they &#39;suddenly&#39; appear onto the scene, here is a great synopsis of the company, its founder and the history from DVD players and videogaming consoles to smartphones today, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/bbk-third-biggest-phone-manufacturer-808839/">via Android Authority</a>. Very good (and short) read.<br /><br />Now on the individual brand races, where is the race? Samsung is flat for the year, keeping its 21% from the year before. Far above Apple who falls from 15% to 14% this past year. And who is rushing up to fight against Apple brand? It is Huawei, who again added a point of market share, and now globally sells 10% of all smartphones (vs 9% a year ago). Apple has lost one point every year last 3 years, while Huawei has gained a point each of the last 3 years. This trends suggests that next year (2019) we will see the iPhone at 12% and Huawei at 12% and the two big global smartphone makers will be literally neck-to-neck. By year 2020 Huawei will have passed Apple.<br /><br />(and behind those two brands, we find the 3 BBK brands, Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus, of course, who combined are larger than either Apple or Huawei. And this year, BBK will start to approach Samsung for the title of top dog...)<br /><br />Now a mathematical curiosity. It looks like we have a perfect symmetry in the top 3 (brand) race in smarthphones globally (annual numbers, of course). Samsung is 45% larger than number 2, Apple. And Apple is 45% larger than number 3 (Huawei). Haha .Nice symmetry there. But that won&#39;t last long. Samsung is holding steady at 21% market share. Apple is bleeding market share one point per year, and Huawei is catching up to Apple one point per year in market share. So in one year it will be more like Samsung ahead of Apple by 56% and Apple ahead of Huawei only by 21%.<br /><br />BTW of the top 3 brands, we know Samsung&#39;s rough semi-official full year number, it is 320 million total smartphones sold (plus another 40 million dumbphones). And for Huawei, we know their official full year 2017 number at 153 million. Apple will end up somewhere near 220 million, maybe a bit under. BBK will be well above 250 million across their three brands.<br /><br />Then in milestones to come. MASSIVE number is upon us, this Spring. I have Samsung cumulative shipments of smartphones lifetime at 1.9 Billion. We&#39;re passing 2.0 Billion cumulative Samsung brand smartphones shipped, sometime this Spring, probably this first quarter. I hope Samsung celebrates that 2 Billionth smartphone in some way. (for comparison, Apple at 1.3 Billion cumulative iPhones since 2007, Nokia next at 600 million smartphones lifetime, and Huawei is next, past 500 million already)<br /><br />Meanwhile in the kiddie table. Where is Nokia&#39;s comeback? I am hoping some analysts will give some numbers on Nokia. For the full year they are well below half a percent as they only started to sell their smartphones to a broad market in the summer. But for Q4, they may well be above 1% market share already. I&#39;d love to see some analyst quote a Nokia HMD smartphone unit count number so we&#39;ll have some visibility to that scale. I was expecting Nokia HMD to sell about 5.4 million. Hopefully we&#39;ll see some numbers too about that. Ok, with all that, lets await the various numbers.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2018/01/are-we-going-to-see-the-10-iphone-in-2020-no-the-clone-of-2010-superphones-will-probably-cost-around.html">Are We Going To See The “$10 iPhone” in 2020? No, the clone of 2010 superphones will probably cost around $20 in 2020</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If you remember my famous forecast from year 2010, that if Moore’s Law holds, then someone can clone any superphone of year 2010, and match those specs by year 2020, for the cost of $10. Superphones of year 2010 included the original iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy, Nokia N8, Blackberry’s Bold, etc. And a superphone back then cost $600 without handset subsidy (ie clean, without contract). Excepting for local taxes and import duties, that price was also pretty well ‘universal’ globally. In year 2010, you’d be expected to pay $600 for a top-line smartphone by a major brand.</p>
<p>To be clear, right from the start, I emphasized, that Apple will not sell us a $10 iPhone in year 2020. I said it would be a clone-phone-maker, probably running Android or possibly one of the low-cost smartphone OS systems that were then in development. But 8 years ago, in year 2010, if you went into a mobile phone shop anywhere, and picked the top model, you’d get roughly the same specs, which were:</p>
<p>3G</p>
<p>Smartphone</p>
<p>Touch Screen</p>
<p>3.5 inch size screen</p>
<p>WiFi</p>
<p>Camera of 5mp</p>
<p>With LED flash</p>
<p>GPS</p>
<p>That was my spec list. If you did that phone today, you are essentially matching an iPhone 4 from year 2010. And that phone was considered a ‘superphone’ back then. A powerful internet-phone on both 3G and WiFi, a ‘real’ camera that was able to capture reasonably good images. A flash that let you take pictures in the dark. GPS for mapping. &#0160;And yes, touch-screen obviously. And back in year 2010, a phone screen of 3.5 inches was considered ‘massive’ in its size. Today it is considered ‘tiny’.</p>
<p>MOORE’S LAW</p>
<p>So I applied Moore’s Law to the tech specs of the iPhone 4, in year 2010. And that law said that computer processing power doubles every 18 months. The corollary to Moore’s Law is that the same performance computer tech will cost half, in 18 months. And then I just ran 18-month cycles and cut the price of the ‘iPhone clone’ into half every 18 months.</p>
<p>This said that the price pattern for a new smartphone, matching 2010 flagship smartphones by spec, which cost $600 in year 2010, should cost as follows:</p>
<p><br /> Summer 2010: cost $600 (starting point)</p>
<p>Winter 2011: cost $300 (was achieved)<br /> Summer 2013: cost $150 (was achieved)</p>
<p>Winter 2014: cost $75 (was achieved)</p>
<p>Summer 2016: cost $38 (was achieved)</p>
<p>Winter 2017: cost $19 (is now due)<br /> Summer 2019: cost $10&#0160;<br /> <br /> And based on this pattern, I boldly forecasted a $10 dollar price for a new smartphone, when sold in year 2020, that (roughly) matched the specs of what once was a superphone, in year 2010. Fair enough. And nicely, this gave us milestones, to see how this forecast was doing. I showed this slide since 2010, with always the latest period highlighted, as we followed how this forecast was turning out:<br /><br /> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://communities-dominate.blogs.com/.a/6a00e0097e337c883301b7c94aab40970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="10-dollar-iphone-clone-year-2020-TomiAhonenConsulting" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e0097e337c883301b7c94aab40970b image-full img-responsive" src="https://communities-dominate.blogs.com/.a/6a00e0097e337c883301b7c94aab40970b-800wi" title="10-dollar-iphone-clone-year-2020-TomiAhonenConsulting" /></a><br /><br /> <br /> That forecast held through 2011, 2013, 2014, and even up to Summer 2016. I was able to find a new smartphone in the summer of 2016, that matched (or exceeded) the specs required, in India, for the local price of 2,443 India Rupees which was $36 US dollars. We were 2 dollars BELOW the target price for the forecast. The forecast looked good.<br /> <br />FORECAST NO LONGER HOLDS<br /><br /> Now I have some bad news. The forecast no longer holds. I have searched a dozen countries and phones of hundreds of brands, and cannot find a smartphone that matches those specs, at a price around $19. The nearest I’ve gotten is again in India. A smartphone by the name of Microkey, model E12, (new phone from Nov 2017) is nearly the specs we want. 4.5 inch (larger than required) touch screen Android smartphone, 8 mp camera (better), with LED flash, 3G and WiFi. But this phone does not have GPS. And it is available locally for $1,799 India Rupees. That is $28 dollars, not $19. We have now failed to match the predicted price path. We are 50% above where it should be.<br /> <br /> This means, first off, that it is nearly certain, that by year 2020, we will not see anyone (yet) selling a new smartphone that matches the 2010 iPhone 4 in specs, and costing only $10. It looks like we’ll fall short from that amazing price point, BUT we ARE on track for a smartphone year 2020, that costs about $20. And considering the collapse in price from $600, then whether it is $20 or $10 doesn’t really matter. We will have achieved a computer into essentially every pocket, even in the Emerging World.<br /> <br /> Note, that the price decline now is proceeding at a slower rate than it has been before. Part of that is the inevitable end to Moore’s Law which some say is upon us, others say will shortly arrive. But in this case, new smartphones costing under $30, we do have the issue of the non-digital elements to the cost of a phone. The plastic casing for the phone is not experiencing a Moore’s Law. Plastic does not become cheaper by half every 18 months. Similarly the battery. Batteries are getting cheaper but nowhere near as fast as Moore’s Law is lowering costs of computing. Also labor costs do not fall by Moore’s Law. The shipping and marketing costs do not fall by the rate of Moore’s Law. So the final non-subsidised non-contract price of a new smartphone model right now, if the bottom end is at $28, only a small part of that price is the electronics of the ‘smart’ and ‘phone’ part. The other elements that do not live by Moore’s Law are now a far larger proportion of this cheap smartphone, than were parts of the original iPhone 4 back in year 2010.<br /> <br />NEW PRICE PREDICTION FOR NEXT 5 YEARS<br /><br /> It WAS a wild ride, for 6 years. We DID match, exactly the predicted price path, up to the summer of 2016. Now that ride has ended. Smartphones are STILL becoming cheaper, but now the price shrinks more slowly. It literally was cut in half every 18 months since 2010, now it seems to be cut by one quarter, every 18 months (ie the price drop rate has fallen into half). This suggests, that going forward, we could expect this type of price pattern at the very lowest end of smartphone prices:<br /> <br /> 2017 Winter cheapest new smartphone $28</p>
<p>2019 Summer cheapest new smartphone $21</p>
<p>2020 Winter cheapest new smartphone $16<br /> 2022 Summer cheapest new smartphone $12<br /> 2023 Winter cheapest new smartphone $9</p>
<p>We should prepare for this pattern and now it is likely in year 2020 we won’t find $10 clones of the 2010 iPhone (by tech specs) and instead, that year we’ll find the first phone at $20, roughly matching the specs of our 2010 iPhone. And if this slower rate of price drop continues, then expect the first new $10 smartphone to be upon us around year 2023.<br /> <br /> PS obviously we ignore the nonsense fake phone deals that never materialized. Secondly, these will not be ‘as good’ smartphones as what the original iPhone 4 or Nokia N8 or Blackberry Bold etc were in year 2010. The cheap clone ‘superphone’ will be very cheap plastic and may have all sorts of quality etc issues. But I am not considering discounted old models sold at prices to get rid of inventory. I mean it has to be a new model that year, that is sold at a fair price in its market. And while we won’t see the $10 smartphone yet in year 2020 we seem to be getting gosh-darned close to that, at $20. And that the $10 smartphone is likely postponed to year 2023. Still, only 5 years from now....<br /> <br /> Even when a precise forecast isn’t coming perfectly to form, I am so happy to be able to revisit old forecasts to see how they are doing. And this one, once again, was a remarkably useful forecast in year 2010, when there were no smartphones really below the $200 level. To be able to give guidance to the industry, that prepare - in a decade, smartphones will cost a tiny fraction of what they were costing back then...<br /> <br /> So for the record. I am now shifting my forecast. No $10 iPhone-clones in year 2020 (yet) but the new target is $20. And the $10 iPhone-clone is likely to arrive around year 2023.</p>

First national numbers for December are out. In Taiwan Nokia HMD ranked 7th with 3.2% Market Share</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So we&#39;re monitoring the Nokia HMD comeback. Hopefully this period (next 7 weeks or so) will bring more numbers. But ONE country has already released national market share numbers that are VERY positive for HMD Nokia&#39;s first reasonably-complete quarter of a portfolio of smartphone sales. It is Taiwan. A rich Asian country, of only about 20 million total population (half the size of South Korea or Malaysia for example) but still - that is almost as much population as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark - combined.<br /><br />What is the verdict? Taiwan domestic December (one month only) market share has Apple first, Samsung second, Asustek third and... in seventh ranking is HMD Nokia with 3.2% market share. This is VERY VERY good news for Nokia/HMD smartphone comeback story. It is so far the only December number we have. But if Nokia and HMD can get near 3% in many Asian countries and many rich world countries in some ways similar to Taiwan - then Nokia HMD could be around 3% for December, then or perhaps closer to 2% for the full Quarter in market share across all such countries. If so... Nokia could well be somewhere near 2% global market share (as its BRAND is far stronger in the Emerging World markets which are not very similar to Taiwan, like say Nigeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Brazil and etc).<br /><br />BTW there is gossip that Nokia HMD might innovate in cameraphones again. A &#39;penta lens&#39; camera setup may be shown at Barcelona, and may be released for late 2018 into the market (possibly for Christmas sales period of this year 2018). Lets see.<br /><br />Meanwhile, GREAT news HMD !!! Great news Nokia !!! We hope for MANY more markets where your first full quarter of a significant portfolio of smartphones, gets you to around 2% market share... gosh that is good news.<br /><br />(NOTE an early version of this article mistakenly said fourth quarter, when the data was only for the month of December)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>UPDATE MONDAY<br /><br />The shutdown is already over (lasted only 3 days). My blog was written on the premise of the recent pattern of prolonged shutdowns. I did write in the blog, that if the Republicans are smart, they will end this shutdown immediately, as it was THEIR mistake. And they did. The shutdown is over. Note that my analysis was assuming a long drama. As it is over, no real sense in reading that long article &#39;of what might have been&#39;. I will leave it of course here onto the blog, if anyone is interested in that analysis but the drama is over. I&#39;d call it a draw. It depends on the aftermath, if there is some marginal gain or loss on either side. I&#39;ll return with more politics later when relevant, and continue now with tech/mobile/media items for the time being. You can read the full article below:<br /><br /></p>
